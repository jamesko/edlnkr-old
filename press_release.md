EdLnkr gives people a way to accelerate lesson-plan creation by enabling people to develop plans by aggregating links to their favorite content and presenting it in an order that allows people to learn material in a systematic way.
The curator will log in to his existing account, create a plan, then add links to the plan.  He can then share his plan with the world when he is ready.

Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
Problem
There are myriad links to educational material online. Some of them are exceptional, some of them are counter-productive.  A search engine such as Google cannot evaluate the suitability of these links.
Describe the problem your product solves.
Solution
People commonly manually and individually sift through links to find solutions to their problems, but, a week later, how many of them could reproduce the steps that they followed to arrive at their resolution?  EdLnkr gives those people a forum to share those links and refine their process into an efficient lesson plan.
